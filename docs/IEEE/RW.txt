* Paper: The Tao of Parallelism in Algorithms
[Insights]
- Parallelism in irregular applications depends on data.
- Dependence graph is not able to find this parallelism.
- Proposes new primitives to code algorithms.
[Similarities]
- Seek to find parallelism in irregular applications.
- "Dependences between activities in irregular algorithms are usu- ally complex
  functions of runtime data values, so they cannot be usefully captured by a
  static dependence graph."
- We agree with the above sentence. Our approach uses a static analysis to
  detect tasks, but it is up to the runtime if we can run that task in
  parallel with other tasks already in flight.
- We can use Delaunay Triangulation as an example of program that we can
  parallelize.
[Differences]
- Requires a new language, or at least new abstractions, to write parallel
  algorithms. Our approach should be totally automatic.
- Our approach still relies on static dependance graphs to find parallelism 
	opportunities.
